This directory contains examples for the Qt3D C++ API.

Qt3D can be used to extend Qt Quick3D with custom 3D items.  Qt3D is also
a general 3D toolkit, featuring a scenegraph API, support for OpenGL VBO's
and other utilities for general 3D programming.

Running "qmake ; make" in either this directory or the example directories
will place any resulting binaries (and any required resources) into qt3d/bin in
the build tree, in line with the logic in pkg.pri.
Note that "make install" should not be run on the qt3d examples except for building packages.

Research work on Qt3D also continues in the labs repository:

  http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qt3d

...and is from time to time ported into Qt Quick3D.

Check the labs version of Qt3D for additional cutting edge features such as
support for stereoscopic hardware.
