This directory contains the QtQuick3D product tree derived from the Qt3D project.

Run qmake and then make to build it against Qt.  As of 10 March 2011 it requires
version 4.7.x of Qt, built with OpenGL and declarative support.  This is standard
for binary distributions of Qt.

As of 10 March 2011 this product tree is being ported to avoid the dependency
on private headers in Qt.  If it fails to build against your version of Qt
try building it against a developer build from source.

You will need to have built Qt with the "-opengl" option.  Run "make install"
afterwards to install the plugins into your Qt build.

Directory structure:

    Scene format loading plugins.
src/imports/
    QML import plugins.
util/
    Various utilities that are useful when working with Qt3D.
examples/
    Some examples of using the Qt3D library.
demos/
    More complex demos of Qt3D, including QtQuick3D for integrating
    Qt3D with the "Qt Quick" Declarative UI component of Qt 4.7.
