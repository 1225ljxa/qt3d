This directory contains miscellaneous utility scripts for use with Qt3D.

filter-qmldump.pl
=================

Use this script to regenerate the library.xml files after making changes
to the properties or structure of the QML bindings.

It expects a file called "library.xml" to be in the current directory, and
requires a single command line argument, which is a string matching the 
module name to filter on.

Typical use:

1) Build and install Qt3D into a given Qt at $QTDIR
2) Ensure $QTDIR/qtc-qmldump exists (see below)
3) Run qmldump to generate the library.xml file:
   $QTDIR/qtc-qmldump/qmldump $QTDIR/imports Qt3D > library.xml
4) Filter the output to just include the Qt3D module:
   filter-qmldump.pl Qt3D > library-qt3d.xml

Repeat 3) & 4) for the Shapes library:
   $QTDIR/qtc-qmldump/qmldump.app/Contents/MacOS/qmldump $QTDIR/imports/Shapes Qt3D.Shapes > library.xml
   filter-qmldump.pl Qt3D > library-qt3d.xml

Note: the "qmldump" utility is specific to the Qt version, since it has to
load the actual QML plugin to generate the XML description of the items.
In binary packages of Qt there should already be a qmldump utility shipped
with the package.  In other cases Qt Creator will build qmldump on the fly
and install it into the relevant Qt build.  However there are several fail
modes: http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/11/30/new-qml-editor-features/

If it doesn't exist, the only way to be sure is to build Qt from source
with the -nokia-developer option, and then run Qt Creator to create a
QML project which uses that version of Qt.
