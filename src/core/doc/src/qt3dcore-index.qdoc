    \title Qt3D Module

    \e Qt3D provides functionality for near-realtime simulation systems
    with support for 2D and 3D rendering in both Qt C++ and Qt Quick
    applications.

    The functionality in Qt3D is divided into the following modules:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-modules

    Classes, types and functions are declared under the \l Qt3D namespace.

    \section1 Getting Started

    For a C++ application that performs 2D or 3D rendering and also handles user
    input, add the following line to your \l qmake \c .pro file:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drenderer 3dinput
    \endcode

    To include the definitions of the modules' classes, use the following
    directives:

    \badcode
    #include <Qt3DCore>
    #include <Qt3DRenderer>
    #include <Qt3DInput>
    \endcode

    A Qt Quick application requires also additional dependencies:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drenderer 3dinput qml quick 3dquick
    \endcode

    \section1 Overview

    The high level design and motivation for Qt3D is described in the
    \l {Qt3D Overview}.

    \section1 Reference
