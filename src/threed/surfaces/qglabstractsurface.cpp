    \class QGLAbstractSurface
    \brief The QGLAbstractSurface class represents an OpenGL drawing surface.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::painting

    OpenGL can be used to draw into a number of different surface types:
    windows, pixel buffers (pbuffers), framebuffer objects, and so on.
    It is also possible to use only part of a surface by setting
    the \c{glViewport()} to restrict drawing to that part.  An example
    of a subsurface may be the left or right eye image of a stereoscopic
    pair that is rendered into the two halves of a window.

    Note that pixelbuffers are only supported when Qt is built with the
    OpenGL library.

    Activating a surface for OpenGL drawing, and deactivating it afterwards
    can be quite varied across surface types.  Sometimes it is enough
    to just make a QOpenGLContext current and set the \c{glViewport()}.
    Other times a context must be made current, followed by binding a
    framebuffer object, and finally setting the \c{glViewport()}.

    QGLAbstractSurface and its subclasses simplify the activation and
    deactivation of surfaces by encapsulating the logic needed to
    use a particular kind of surface into activate() and deactivate()
    respectively.

    Normally surfaces are activated by calling QGLPainter::pushSurface()
    as in the following example of switching drawing to a framebuffer
    object:

    \code
    QGLPainter painter;
    painter.begin(widget);
    QGLFramebufferObjectSurface surface(fbo);
    painter.pushSurface(&surface);
    ... // draw into the fbo
    painter.popSurface();
    ... // draw into the widget
    \endcode

    QGLPainter maintains a stack of surfaces, starting with the paint
    device specified to QGLPainter::begin() (usually a widget).
    The QGLPainter::pushSurface() function calls deactivate() on the
    current surface, activate() on the new surface, and then adjusts the
    \c{glViewport()} to match the value of viewportGL() for the new surface.
    When QGLPainter::popSurface() is called, the previous surface
    is re-activated and the \c{glViewport()} changed accordingly.

    \sa QGLPixelBufferSurface, QGLPainter::pushSurface()

    Activate this surface.

    If \a prevSurface is null, then that surface has just been deactivated
    in the process of switching to this surface.  This may allow activate()
    to optimize the transition to avoid unnecessary state changes.

    Typically implementations should assert if this fails in debug mode,
    since no rendering into the surface is possible.

    \fn void QGLAbstractSurface::deactivate(QGLAbstractSurface *nextSurface)

    Deactivate this surface from the current context, but leave the
    context current.  Typically this will release the framebuffer
    object associated with the surface.

    If \a nextSurface is not-null, then that surface will be activated next
    in the process of switching away from this surface.  This may allow
    deactivate() to optimize the transition to avoid unnecessary state
    changes.

/*!
    \fn QRect QGLAbstractSurface::viewportGL() const

    Returns the rectangle of the surface that is occupied by
    the viewport for this surface.  The origin is at the bottom-left,
    which makes the value suitable for passing to \c{glViewport()}:

    \code
    QRect viewport = surface->viewportGL();
    glViewport(viewport.x(), viewport.y(), viewport.width(), viewport.height());
    \endcode

    Normally the viewport rectangle is the full extent of the device(),
    but it could be smaller if the application only wishes to draw
    into a subpart of the device().  An example would be rendering left
    and right stereo eye images into the two halves of a QGLWidget.
    The eye surfaces would typically be instances of QGLSubsurface.

    Note that the value returned from this function is not defined before
    the activate() function has been called at least once.
