    \target Monkey-God in QML
    \section2 Monkey-God in QML

    This example shows how to structure animations and objects together
    in a scene to produce some quite complex behaviour.  This technique
    is good for screensavers, simulations and even simple games.

    As usual (after setting up our imports - see the \l{Cube Example}) we
    create our viewport, and give it a black background.  Also a camera
    is specified, since the default one is at (10, 0, 0) and we want one
    a bit further away and elevated to see the scene better.

    Next we add our monkey-god himself, with a nice gold effect material
    (which is specifed later in the file) and he is set up to orient towards
    the central one of our penguin followers.

    The penguin followers are positioned in two ranks, using a Penguin
    component that is created in the file Penguin.qml.  The Asset Viewer tool
    can help you create component files like this from your models.  We give
    the penguins a \l{Rotation3D} which we name \c swivel1 so that a
    NumberAnimation can be applied to it.

    The code for the first rank of penguins is shown here, and the second rank
    is coded in a similar way:
