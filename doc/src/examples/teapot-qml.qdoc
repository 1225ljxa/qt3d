    \title Teapot Example in QML

    This example shows to use QML in \l{Qt 3D} to display a teapot on
    the screen.  The QML is fairly simple:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_qml/qml/teapot.qml 1

    \image teapot-qml-screenshot.png

    The example starts by importing the Qt and Qt 3D QML modules:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_qml/qml/teapot.qml 2

    Then we create a viewport of size 640x480 to display the teapot:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_qml/qml/teapot.qml 3

    And now we create a \l Item3D to display the teapot with a
    default lit material effect:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_qml/qml/teapot.qml 4

    The teapot data itself is loaded from \c{teapot.bez}, which contains
    Bezier patch data that describes the geometry of the teapot.

    Let's make the teapot a little more interesting by adding a
    material to simulate bone china:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_bounce_qml/qml/teapot-bounce.qml 1
    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_bounce_qml/qml/teapot-bounce.qml 2

    \image teapot-china-screenshot.png

    To make the teapot even more interesting, we can cause it to
    bounce up and down using a QML animation item:

    \snippet ../../tutorials/quick3d/teapot_bounce_qml/qml/teapot-bounce.qml 3

    This QML teapot example can be compared with the \l{qt3d/teapot}{C++ version}.
    Using QML is briefer than C++, and easier to modify to adjust
    materials and add new features like animations.
