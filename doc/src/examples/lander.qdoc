    \title Lunar Lander Example

    \target Lunar Lander in QML
    \section2 Lunar Lander in QML

    This example demonstrates the basis for what could be a simple game.  To
    create the game background we load an image of stars.

    \snippet ../../examples/quick3d/lander/qml/lander.qml 1

    Then inside the Image element our Viewport is constructed, and we tell it to fill
    its parent.  Since the Viewport will be composited on top of the Image, we tell
    the viewport to use a BufferedRender mode.  Generally Qt3D will detect the fact
    that the Viewport is not the top level element and try to do the right thing, but
    it does not hurt to make it specific.

    Now we load our lunar landscape which is an OBJ format model and scale & position
    it to suit.  Note that our camera is set up to track our lander as it moves above
    the landscape (see the source file for that detail).  Usually you can rely on the
    default position of the camera which is pointing at (0, 0, 0).  Here we position
    the landscape just below the origin.

    Next the lunar lander spacecraft is loaded, and a rusty texture applied to it. We
    have created some transforms to capture the motion of the lander, and make it
    behave appropriately when the UI causes a rocket boost to occur.

    \snippet ../../examples/quick3d/lander/qml/lander.qml 4

    To control the lander we create a UI element by installing a MouseArea.  This
    snippet just shows the Y change handler, but there is a similar one for X.
    Activating these causes the boost game logic to increment, and thus to have
    the position of the lander changed, and the the jet animation fire.

    \snippet ../../examples/quick3d/lander/qml/lander.qml 5

    The rest of the game logic is added in using javascript.  See the source for
    complete details.
